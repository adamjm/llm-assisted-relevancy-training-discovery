This date will be at least 28 days from the date of the giving of this notice.

We will tell you how much to pay and when payment is due on your certificate of insurance. If we agree, you can pay the premium by instalments but it costs less to pay annually.

Your premium includes any applicable GST, stamp duty, other government charges and any levies that apply. The premium will be shown on your certificate of insurance as the ‘Total Amount Payable’ or, if you pay by monthly instalments, as ‘Instalment amount’. The amount of the premium reflects our assessment of the likelihood of you making a claim and our costs of doing business. We use many factors about you and your car to calculate the premium. Refer to the Car Insurance Additional Information Guide for more information.

47. How do inflation protection increases in cover amounts work?	b360796b8bf23b6211357b28da834eef_65	Benefit amounts increase each year up to the policy anniversary after age 70 in line with changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as last published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics or its successors in respect of the 12 month period ending 30 September in each year or by 5%, whichever is greater. Premiums will also increase accordingly. If the CPI is not published, we will select another similar indicator of inflation. Where the indexation factor is negative, we will not apply a change to your level of cover. The maximum benefit amount that can result after inflation protection is $2,500,000. If you don’t wish to receive the increase you will need to let us know.	 	b360796b8bf23b6211357b28da834eef_67	Premium rates are not guaranteed. Your premium will change when any of the following events occur: • your premium will increase each year in accordance with your age and any increase to your benefits, such as Inflation Protection increases in cover amounts; • if you make any changes to your policy; • if your benefit amount is increased or decreased; • if you add or remove a cover or option; • if you make changes to your policy, any discount that applies may change, or cease to apply; • if there are changes in government duty or taxes and we choose to pass on these additional costs. If this happens, we will give you 30 days’ written notice; or • we choose to increase the underlying premium rates on our AAMI Life Insurance portfolio.

48. How does the insurer determine the premium rates?	b360796b8bf23b6211357b28da834eef_68	The cost of your cover is not guaranteed to remain the same each year. We can change the premium rates we use to determine your premium. Decisions to change premium rates do not occur because of changes to an individual customer’s own circumstances, but rather are determined in relation to the group of customers that we insure. We will act reasonably when making decisions to change our premium rates and will only make changes to the extent reasonably necessary to protect our legitimate business interests. Our premiums are determined so that the total premium for our group of insured customers is sufficient to cover our expected future claims costs, meeting our associated costs of doing business and margins in providing cover to you. We review associated factors on an ongoing basis which may include, but are by no means limited to, our assessment of regulatory or legislative requirements, our operating costs or the commercial environment. These are only some examples of factors that we 	 	b360796b8bf23b6211357b28da834eef_67	Premium rates are not guaranteed.

If this happens, we will give you 30 days’ written notice; or • we choose to increase the underlying premium rates on our AAMI Life Insurance portfolio. Please see next section.	 	b360796b8bf23b6211357b28da834eef_64	The cost of your policy depends on a range of factors, including but not limited to the type of cover, your age and gender, whether or not you smoke, the length of time you have had your policy and how often you choose to pay your premiums. We may also take your occupation, health, income, personal pastimes, lifestyle and other factors into account in determining insurance premium amounts. We ask for this information so that the premiums we charge take into account the different levels of risk presented by different customer groups. Sometimes discounts may apply to certain policies; however, these may not apply for the full term of your policy. Once we know a little bit about you and the cover you require, we can provide you with an indicative quote for your premium. The quoted premium may change once we have all the information we require to complete our assessment of an application for cover. All premiums are payable in advance, by the due date shown in your policy schedule.

TAL Direct has been authorised under an arrangement called a ‘binder’: • by TAL Life, for life cover; to: • enter into, vary or cancel insurance cover; and • until 8 December 2021, manage, administer and settle claims; on behalf of the insurer as if it was the insurer. This means that TAL Direct is acting for the insurer in these circumstances. From 9 December 2021, TAL Direct will cease to manage, administer and settle claims on behalf of the insurer. TAL Direct’s authority is subject to the limits of authority agreed to with this insurer.

If the age of the life insured has been overstated, we will refund any excess premium paid. Where the terms and conditions of a benefit vary by the age of the life insured, the correct age of the life insured, if applicable, will be used to determine whether a benefit is payable. We may also vary the end date of the policy to what it would have been had the correct date of birth been provided by the life insured.

Can I get a new policy if I cancel my existing one?	b360796b8bf23b6211357b28da834eef_91	You can have two lives insured on the same policy, subject to them meeting entry age and Australian resident requirements and satisfying income, health and lifestyle criteria. Each life insured can have a different amount of Comprehensive Life Cover. Both lives insured will be shown individually on your policy schedule along with their respective premium. If more than one life insured is covered under this policy, a reference to a life insured means each respective life insured individually. You may add a new life insured to your policy after the cover commencement date (if you did not add one at the cover commencement date), subject to the life insured meeting entry age requirements, and satisfying health and lifestyle criteria, where applicable.

How do taxation laws apply to my policy?	b360796b8bf23b6211357b28da834eef_73	If you are considering the tax implications of purchasing and receiving benefits under AAMI Life Insurance, it is important you seek independent, professional taxation advice.

It is your responsibility to select a sum insured for the building that meets your needs in the event the building is damaged or destroyed. To help you calculate the replacement value of the building, we provide a ‘Home Building’ calculator that you can access at our website www.aami.com.au. You can also choose to seek the services of an architect, builder, quantity surveyor, valuer or other suitably qualified professional for an expert opinion.	 	057d9148a4d1cb46a710f73fcd3bbd60_30	To ensure your sum insured is adequate it is important to review it regularly, being mindful of any additions, enhancements or renovations that you may make and ask us to change the sum insured when required. If you upgrade the size and standard of the building, it may increase the cost to rebuild the building. Your building sum insured will need to reflect these types of changes. If you do not contact us when you need to, you may not be covered under your policy and it may lead us to reduce or refuse to pay a claim and/or cancel your policy. If you over-insure	 	b360796b8bf23b6211357b28da834eef_68	The cost of your cover is not guaranteed to remain the same each year. We can change the premium rates we use to determine your premium. Decisions to change premium rates do not occur because of changes to an individual customer’s own circumstances, but rather are determined in relation to the group of customers that we insure. We will act reasonably when making decisions to change our premium rates and will only make changes to the extent reasonably necessary to protect our legitimate business interests. Our premiums are determined so that the total premium for our group of insured customers is sufficient to cover our expected future claims costs, meeting our associated costs of doing business and margins in providing cover to you. We review associated factors on an ongoing basis which may include, but are by no means limited to, our assessment of regulatory or legislative requirements, our operating costs or the commercial environment. These are only some examples of factors that we 	 	057d9148a4d1cb46a710f73fcd3bbd60_33	You must keep your contact details, including your Australian Mobile number, postal address and email address up to date. If we do not have up to date contact details you might not receive your important policy documents which could impact whether you have cover in place. AAMI will consider a range of factors that can influence the cost to rebuild the building. We may choose to adjust the building sum insured shown on your certificate of insurance at the end of each period of insurance to account for various factors including inflationary trends. However, you need to consider if the building sum insured is sufficient for your situation.

What is the difference between the Complete Replacement CoverÂ® optional cover and a building sum insured?	057d9148a4d1cb46a710f73fcd3bbd60_26	AAMI offers cover on a sum insured basis or you may be able to choose the option of Complete Replacement Cover® see section 6 ‘Optional covers you can pay extra for’, on page 65. This section ‘About your sum insured’ does not apply if you have the Complete Replacement Cover® optional cover. This is because under that option we cover insured loss or damage to the building up to the amount of the assessed quote to repair or rebuild on a ‘new for old’ basis. See ‘If your policy has Optional Complete Replacement Cover®’ on page 76 for more details.	 	057d9148a4d1cb46a710f73fcd3bbd60_137	You may be able to insure the building under our Complete Replacement Cover® option, instead of on a building sum insured basis. This option can only be added to your policy at certain times, such as when you purchase your policy or renew it. If you would like this option, please ask us. We may ask you to supply additional details about the building. Your answers to our questions will be shown on your certificate of insurance and we will rely on your answers as the basis of our assessment of the cover we will provide. If the Complete Replacement Cover® option is added to the building insurance policy and you pay for this optional cover, it will be shown on your certificate of insurance and you will not have a building sum insured. Complete Replacement Cover® does not cover everything as shown in the `We don’t cover’ sections of the following tables.	 	057d9148a4d1cb46a710f73fcd3bbd60_185	If we replace or pay you the full sum insured for an item or the total cost to repair or rebuild the building (when you have the Complete Replacement Cover® option), we then own the damaged or recovered item.

If a defect arises in the lifetime of the building as a result of poor quality workmanship then we will rectify the problem. It is a condition of our guarantee that we reserve the right to decide who will undertake the rectification work. If we only pay part of the sum insured to you (or only part of the total cost to repair or rebuild the building if you have the Complete Replacement Cover® option), your policy continues for the period of insurance. If we pay the full sum insured to you or pay you the total cost to rebuild the building (when you have the Complete Replacement Cover® option), all cover under the building policy stops on the day we pay your claim or otherwise finalise your claim. There is no refund of premium.

How we settle building claims If you accept the offer If you choose to not accept the offer You will be paid the building sum insured. We will aim to use a member of our supplier network to repair or rebuild the damage to the building. Sometimes, this is not always possible e.g. if there is pre-existing damage. This will determine how the building claim will be settled.

If you want to downsize the building for less cost than you are entitled to claim, we will not pay more than the assessed quote provided from a member of our supplier network to rebuild the downsized building. For example, if your three bedroom building is damaged in a storm and has to be rebuilt, and you choose that you want to downsize to a smaller two bedroom building, the most we will pay is the assessed quote from our builder to rebuild the smaller two bedroom building. • to repairs you authorise or make yourself; • to loss, damage or failure of any electrical or mechanical appliances or machines; • to wear and tear consistent with normal gradual deterioration of the building; • where we agree with a repair quot	 	057d9148a4d1cb46a710f73fcd3bbd60_161	We will rebuild or repair to the same type, standard and specification (but not brand) to the damaged items as when new.
